Chart Dataset
=============

Before creating a chart content element you need to create a dataset that can be used by chart libraries.
Go to list view and create a new chart data record. On default labels, data and data labels are configured with TYPO3's table wizard.

The following example screenshot shows you how to create such a dataset when your TYPO3 installation also provides the `spreadsheet extension <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/spreadsheets/>`_.
